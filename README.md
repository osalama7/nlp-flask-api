## Introduction

This Python API is designed to perform sentiment analysis on text data. It uses machine learning to classify text into positive or negative sentiment categories. The API provides two main endpoints: one for training the sentiment analysis model and another for making predictions on text data.

## Getting Started

To get started with this API, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/your-python-api.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd your-python-api
   ```

3. Install the required dependencies (see the [Dependencies](#dependencies) section).

4. Start the API by running:

   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```

5. The API should now be running and accessible at `http://localhost:5000`.

## API Endpoints

### Training the Model

- **Endpoint**: `/api/nlp/logistic`
- **Method**: POST
- **Description**: Train the sentiment analysis model by providing positive and negative training data.

### Making Predictions

- **Endpoint**: `/api/nlp/predict`
- **Method**: POST
- **Description**: Make sentiment predictions on text data using the trained model.

## Usage

To use this API, you can make HTTP POST requests to the provided endpoints. The API expects input data in JSON format, and it will return the results in JSON format as well. Here are some example use cases:

- Training the sentiment analysis model:

  ```bash
  curl -X POST -F "Arabic_tweets_positive=@positive_tweets.csv" -F "Arabic_tweets_negative=@negative_tweets.csv" http://localhost:5000/api/nlp/logistic
  ```

- Making predictions on text data:

  ```bash
  curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"text": "This is a positive message."}' http://localhost:5000/api/nlp/predict
  ```

## Dependencies

- Flask
- pandas
- numpy
- nltk
- requests

You can install these dependencies using pip:

```bash
pip install flask pandas numpy nltk requests
```
